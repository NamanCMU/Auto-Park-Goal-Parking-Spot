Auto-Park-Goal-Parking-Spot
===========================

It contains all the main files which are used to start different actions like create map of the environment (Create_map.launch), initiate parking and un-parking of the robot, etc. You can directly run these files provided everything else is set up like SBPL Lattice Planner, ROS Serial, Hector Mapping and Hokuyo node.
